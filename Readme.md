# Ensuring Positive Definiteness  - Python Library

A complete library to implement a method to ensure positive definiteness in linear viscoelastic materials represented as a prony series. Able to read an excel file, interconvert either material function to the other. Find the modulus at a time, check for positive definiteness, find nearest symmetric positive definite matrix, and finally check the convolution integral.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

This python library requires the Scipy, Numpy, and Pandas python libraries to run.

```
import pandas as pd
import numpys as np
import scipy.integrate as integrate
import scipy.linalg as linalg
from numpy import linalg as la
```


### Installing

To install: 

Download and import the library. 

```
import interconversion as inter 
```  


## Running the tests

Tests have not been implemented yet.
